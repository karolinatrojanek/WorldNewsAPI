# World News API

This API allows you to access to thousands of news sources in over 50 languages from over 150 countries. News are semantically tagged allowing for semantic news search like never before.

The API is available at https://api.apilayer.com/world_news

I found some mistakes in documentation provided on the site https://apilayer.com/marketplace/world_news-api#endpoints, documentation below is altered version of it after testing.

## API Authentication

All requests made to the API must hold a custom HTTP header named "apikey".
API requests can be made over HTTPS or HTTP. 
API requests without authentication will also fail.

## Endpoints
